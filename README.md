# Flights

Flights is a command-line utility application written in Ruby to scrape selected web pages for the best flight deals of the day. It helps you avoid browsing countless websites for flight information by providing a simple command-line interface that will curate the best deals for you.

## How it works

The application is highly configurable through command-line arguments. It uses passed-in options such as Location and Destination to filter search results scraped from web pages. The result is sorted in ascending order of price before display, and the user can navigate between them by issuing pre-configured commands.

## Built With

- Ruby

## Installation

Requirements:

- Ruby >= 2.7.2
- JRuby >= 9.2.0.0

## Command Line options

Flights currently accept the following command-line arguments

- `-from`‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ-‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉUser Location. Search result will include only flights from the given location.
- `-to`‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ-‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉFlight Destination.
- `-today`‚ÄÉ -‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉInclude only today's flights

>Examples
